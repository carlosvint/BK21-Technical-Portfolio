\textbf{Relationship between the age of the plane and its delay time}
\end{large}
\end{center}


This report investigates the relationship between an airplane's age and its arrival/departure delay time. I analyzed delay times for all flights leaving New York City during 2013 using visualization and statistical tools. The results show no relationship between a plane's age and its delay time.

\underline{\textbf{Dataset}}

The dataset used is called 'nycflights13' and has information on more than 300k flights including date, delay time, carrier,  flight number, etc. The dataset also includes metadata on airlines, airports, weather and planes.  


\underline{\textbf{Methodology}}

For each flight, the plane manufacture year and decade was annotated. Only positive departure and arrival delay times were considered (negative values represent early departures/arrivals). Pearson's Correlation was performed between delay time and manufactured year, while multinomial logistic regression was conducted for planes manufactured decade. 


\underline{\textbf{Results}}

Pearson correlation coefficient showed no statistical association between a plane's age and its departure/arrival delay time (p=0.05). Multinomial logistic regression did not find any statistical evidence linking delay time and a plane's manufactured decade (p=0.05).

\end{small}
\end{center}
\underline{\textbf{Conclusions}}

There is no visual or statistical evidence suggesting a relationship between a plane's age and it's departure/arrival delay time. This results suggests that delay time for flights departing NYC in 2013 are influenced by other variables except for a plane's age.
