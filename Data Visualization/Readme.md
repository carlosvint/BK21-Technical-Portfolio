### Gephi

The gephy directory contains the matrices necessary to reconstruct a Disease Gene Network as described in Goh et.al 2007. The directory also includes the gephy file to 
draw the network. 

The network is segmented by modularity:

and allows analysis to find the most important genes for a specific disease type. For example, for metabolism related diseases the most involved genes are:
