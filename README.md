# BK21-Technical-Portfolio

This is my Technical Porfolio of projects realized during the course of my Masters Degree. 

Computer-vision-project contains a Computer Vision model named Conformer which is originally trained on a supervised scheme and I applied a well known self supervised learning algorithm (SimCLR) to improve performance over the baseline. I also compared the attention maps originally presented on the publication versus the attention maps obtained with the new self supervised learning scheme.

wav2vec2-main and simclr-main correspond to my thesis project. They are both widely known self-supervised learning schemes. wav2vec2 is a speech recognition model developed by Facebook, while SimCLR is a contrastive learning algorithm mainly used in computer vision. Both models are modified to improve basecalling performance. Basecalling is part of DNA sequencing and is a process that uses machine learning to map a signal to its corresponding nucleotide base. To improve accuracy and reduce the need of data, I applied both SSL algorithms to improve performance.

The contest folder has a transformer neural network I used for the contest: https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235961/overview/description

The data visualization has the contents from Assignments and project of the Data Visualization class in R as well as RMD files for report writing. In the Gephy folder I visualize a network of genes and the disease they correspond to, and all the matrixes necessary to generate the visualizations.
